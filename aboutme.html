    <p class="writing">Hello, my name is Haylee Cheang. I am a student at Piedmont High, and have grown up in Piedmont for most all of my life.
    I currently live with my mom, dad, sister, and dog named Mika. Mika is an australian poodle, also known as "aussie-doodles." My sister, Chloe, 
    is in 7th grade at Piedmont Middle School. I am currently in my computer science class writing this paragraph to describe myself, and my life.</p>
    
    <p class="writing">I am 14 years old currently, but turn 15 in the summer. I am invested in dance and art, and overall vibe with everything. I like ducks and foxes,
    and play videogames in my free time. I don't exactly know where my future is headed, but I'm chilling with whatever direction it's headed, and try
    by best to make every day somehow productive.</p>
    
    <p class="writing">I strongly advocate for mental health awareness, and am working towards understanding how to understand myself and others. This, meaning that
    I try to take things with a grain of salt and aknowledge positives and negatives of each day to desensitize myself to scolding negative emotions. I strongly
    care about positivity!</p>
    <p class= "smiles"> :)  :)  :)</p>
