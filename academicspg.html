<p class="header3">6th Grade Lip Sync Competition -</p>
<p>A very interesting time in my life where we performed a 30 second lip sync performance in front of the grade in our acting elective. The teacher was Mr. Scherman, and he recorded videos of everyone's preformance! We had practice times and chose our songs and remixes that we used. Although my group was not the best, it was definitely a memorable experience.

<p class="header3">8th Grade Graduation -</p>
<p>Finally coming out of waves of lockdowns and quarantines, the whole class of 2025 was able to finally be in the same environment as one another again. After being separated into two cohorts (A and B) to accommodate for the hybrid schedule, the whole class got to see and connect with students they hadn’t seen in nearly 2 years.

<p class="header3">Beauty and the Beast Musical -</p>
<p>An eventful and fun experience that made memories for the years to come. I was able to connect and meet many of the upperclassmen and grow friendships with most. The dance numbers and the singing numbers were all so fun to learn. A big thanks to Ms. Belles and Ms. Moorhead for directing us in this extravagant preformance. Tremendous effort went into the production, making the final show all worthwhile.

<p class="header3">iSearch -</p>
<p>The iSearch was a laborious project in my 9th grade English class spanning over months of hard work. My topic revolved around the horror genre, and the psychology behind the thrill or fear of the content that it holds. The iSearch is a multi-resource based project where students are expected to demonstrate their own conducted research, an interview, and another study/experience to fully understand their topic.

<p class="header3">Cinematography / Photography -</p>
<p>I enjoy filmmaking and photography, and wish to continue a career in these fields. I’ve always enjoyed making short films and other forms of entertainment, while also being a creative person, capable of making and photoshopping my own creative stories. I was a part of the Yearbook committee in first semester, and provided the team with many photos to feature and include in their page spreads, as well as constructing my own. Overall, photography and the use of cameras have been a very important paprt of my life.

<p class="header3">Psychology -</p>
<p>Psychology has always intrigued me and interested me, and I might consider it as a profession or major/minor in college. I like to evaluate and observe people in day-to-day life and try to understand them. This is why a large portion of me strives to learn more about the scientific mechanics behind human behavior and interractions. I like to learn more about brain chemistry and other brain mechanics.

<p class="header3">Dance Elective -</p>
<p>I like to dance, but to continue dancing outside of school when academic requirements are needed, I don’t think I’d be able to keep doing it. I am planning to take the dance elective sometime in my Sophomore or Junior year to meet the requirement for the art or P.E. credit. The dance program at PHS is a mix of jazz, contemporary, and other genres. I enjoy these different genres and think it would be fun to do all of them but not individually. I also know that the dance program at PHS is not the strongest, and think that I could help benefit it.

<p class="header3">Marine Sciences -</p>
<p>I signed up for the marine sciences course offered in the upcoming school year. I like marine biology, and am interested in having a nuanced understanding of oceanic life. Oceans are really important to our world, and I hope that this course could teach me how to appreciate it more. Marine life is particularly harmed by humans, and I want to know more about individual animals and plants so that I understand how to respect them better. I don’t know much, which inspired me to take the course to learn more about the topic.

<p class="header3">This Website -</p>
<p> This website is my second semester final for my computer science class. It incorporates two different subprojects that we have had over the semester and have compiled into this one, final product. This project was created by using HTML, CSS, and subline. It was not created from a pre-made template, and I customized each project to fit my stylistic likings.</p>
<p> Computer science in general is useful in more than just creating websites about yourself. Computer science is utilized in the creation of videogames, apps, AI, simulations, data analysis, and much more. It can be found used in every aspect of daily life, and has allowed society to progress technologically over the years. Personally, I find interest in the videogame aspect of computer science usage. Videogames touch on the technological, creative, and psychological aspects of artwork as they attempt to appeal to their audiences with their unique creations and games. Overall, computer science is essential in modern life and deserves appreciation for all of its background work. </p>
